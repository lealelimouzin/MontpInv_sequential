MontpInv is a software designed to represent narrow underground structures, such as fractures or preferential flowpaths for instance, based on electrical data and a discrete modelling approach.

This software is an iterative (i.e. step-by-step) inversion procedure that incorporates an adaptation of the forward model obtained with ERT_DDP_2.5D software (Caballero Sanz et al., 2017). Scripts are written in MATLAB and call a C++ executable.
It is related to several folders which content is discribed in the notice available in the Documentation folder, and the script called mainExecutable.m is the one that must be run to start inversion.

Note ElectricalResistivity folder should be unzipped before running the program.
