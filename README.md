# MontpInv_sequential

MontpInv_sequential is a software aiming to represent narrow structures of the subsurface, such as fractures or preferential flowpaths for instance, based on electrical data and a discrete modelling approach.

This software is an inversion procedure that incorporates an adaptation of the forward model obtained with ERT_DDP_2.5D software (Caballero Sanz et al., 2017). Codes are written in MATLAB but called C++ executable. For any questions concerning the installation and operation of the codes, please contact the authors. It is under the GNU licence.

The software is related to several folders and the script called mainExecutable.m is the one that must be run to start inversion. All folders and files are described in the Documentation folder.
