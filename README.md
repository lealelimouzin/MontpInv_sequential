# MontpInv_sequential

## Description

MontpInv_sequential is a software aiming to represent narrow structures of the subsurface, such as fractures or preferential flowpaths for instance, based on electrical data and a discrete modelling approach.

This software is a sequential (i.e. step-by-step) inversion procedure that incorporates an adaptation of the forward model obtained with ERT_DDP_2.5D software (Caballero Sanz et al., 2017). Codes are written in MATLAB but call a C++ executable.
It is related to several folders which content is discribed in the Documentation folder, and the script called mainExecutable.m is the one that must be run to start inversion.
